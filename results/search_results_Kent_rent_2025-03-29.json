However, the tenant will still need to cover the Landlord's costs in surrendering the tenancy and re-letting the property.<br/>*\tWhere an out of hours call out is applicable this will be charged at \u00a315 per hour incl. VAT. Normal business hours are Monday to Friday 9am to 6pm and Saturday 9am to 4pm, therefore out of hours is considered outside of these times.<br/>*\tShould a tenant wish to make changes to the contract (a written variation of contract) such as permission for a pet, to redecorate, to sublet - then a fee of \u00a350 incl. VAT or reasonable costs if higher will be applicable.<br/>For any individual tenant not renting a property under an Assured Shorthold Tenancy the following charges are also payable:<br/>*\tTenant reference charge (\u00a360 per tenant incl. VAT) covers collecting and verifying references from employer/accountant and previous landlord references, as well as carrying out a credit check and collecting a copy of passport, proof of residency, bank statements and a recent payslip.<br/>*\tGuarantor charge (\u00a360 incl. VAT per guarantor if required) covers credit referencing and preparing a Letter of Guarantee as part of the Tenancy Agreement.<br/>*\tProfessional check-in fee (\u00a3150 incl VAT) enables us to arrange a date and time with the tenant to be checked in at the start of the tenancy and checked out at the end of the tenancy, instruct inventory providers, agree the terms of the security deposit disbursement between Landlord and tenant, return deposit as agreed with the Landlord and tenant to relevant parties, remit any disputed amount to the Tenancy Deposit Scheme for final adjudication, unprotect security deposit, instruct contractors and obtain quotes, organise repairs/replacements/cost of any broken or missing items.<br/>All prices are inclusive of VAT.<br/>Rest assured, as a member of The Property Ombudsman (TPO) for lettings we subscribe to TPO's Codes of Practice.
