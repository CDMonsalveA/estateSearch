# Machine Learning Pipeline

The machine learning pipeline is a sequence of steps that are followed to build and deploy a machine learning model. The pipeline consists of the following stages:

## Problem Formulation

- Define the problem to be solved.
- Define the objectives of the model.
- Define the success criteria for the model.
- Define the stakeholders and their requirements.
- Define the data sources and their availability.

## Collect and label data

## Evaluate data

## Feature Engineering

## Select and Train Model

## Evaluate Model

## Tune Model

## Meets Business Objectives?

## If yes, deploy the model

## If no, go back to the previous step and repeat the process

## Monitor Model
