# Machine Learning Pipeline

The machine learning pipeline is a sequence of steps that are followed to build and deploy a machine learning model. The pipeline consists of the following stages:

## Problem Formulation

- Define the problem to be solved.
- Define the objectives of the model.
- Define the success criteria for the model.
- Define the stakeholders and their requirements.
- Define the data sources and their availability.

## Collect and label data

- Collect data from various sources.
- Label the data if necessary.
- Clean the data to remove any noise or irrelevant information.

## Evaluate data

- Analyze the data to understand its structure and characteristics.
- Identify any missing or inconsistent data.
- Identify any outliers or anomalies in the data.
- Identify any correlations or relationships between the data points.
- Identify any patterns or trends in the data.

## Feature Engineering

- Select the relevant features from the data.
- Transform the features to make them suitable for the model.
- Create new features if necessary.
- Scale the features to ensure they are on the same scale.

## Select and Train Model

- Select the appropriate model for the problem.
- Train the model using the training data.

## Evaluate Model

- Evaluate the model using the validation data.
- Measure the performance of the model using the success criteria defined in the problem formulation stage.
- Compare the performance of the model with the baseline model.

## Tune Model

- Tune the hyperparameters of the model to improve its performance.
- Use techniques such as grid search or random search to find the best hyperparameters.
- Use cross-validation to ensure the model is not overfitting or underfitting.
- Use techniques such as regularization to prevent overfitting.

## Meets Business Objectives?

- Does the model meet the success criteria defined in the problem formulation stage?
- Does the model meet the requirements of the stakeholders?
- Does the model provide value to the business?

## If yes, deploy the model

- Deploy the model to production.
- Monitor the performance of the model in production.

## If no, go back to the previous step and repeat the process

- Go back to the feature engineering stage and repeat the pro
cess.
- Go back to the model selection stage and repeat the process.

## Monitor Model

- Monitor the performance of the model in production.
